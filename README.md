# proxycheck-php
php library for calling the [proxycheck.io](https://proxycheck.io/) v2 API which allows you to check if an IP address is a Proxy or VPN and get the Country, ASN and Provider for the IP address being checked. This library also supports checking email addresses to determine if they belong to a disposable email service or not.

## Install via Composer ##

You can install the library via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) by running the following command:

```bash
composer require proxycheck/proxycheck-php
```
To use the library, use Composer's [autoload](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#autoloading):

```php
require_once('vendor/autoload.php');
```

## Dependencies ##

The library requires the following extensions in order to work properly:

- [`curl`](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php) (Please make sure your [cacert.pem](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html) is up to date if you intend to use TLS querying)
- [`json`](https://secure.php.net/manual/en/book.json.php)

## Service Limits ##

* Free users without an API Key = 100 Daily Queries
* Free users with an API Key = 1,000 Daily Queries
* Paid users with an API Key = 10,000 to 10.24 Million+ Daily Queries

Get your API Key at [proxycheck.io](http://proxycheck.io/) it's free.

## Getting Started ##

Performing a check on an address (IPv4 and IPv6 IP addresses are supported along with email addresses for disposable mailbox checking.).

```php
// Get your visitors IP address or email address
// If you're using CloudFlare change $_SERVER["REMOTE_ADDR"] to $_SERVER["HTTP_CF_CONNECTING_IP"]
// You may also supply an array of addresses in $address to check multiple addresses at once.
$address = $_SERVER["REMOTE_ADDR"];

// Input your options for this query including your optional API Key and query flags.
$proxycheck_options = array(
  'API_KEY' => '######-######-######-######', // Your API Key.
  'ASN_DATA' => 1, // Enable ASN data response.
  'DAY_RESTRICTOR' => 7, // Restrict checking to proxies seen in the past # of days.
  'VPN_DETECTION' => 1, // Check for both VPN's and Proxies instead of just Proxies.
  'RISK_DATA' => 1, // 0 = Off, 1 = Risk Score (0-100), 2 = Risk Score & Attack History.
  'INF_ENGINE' => 1, // Enable or disable the real-time inference engine.
  'TLS_SECURITY' => 0, // Enable or disable transport security (TLS).
  'QUERY_TAGGING' => 1, // Enable or disable query tagging.
  'MASK_ADDRESS' => 1, // Anonymises the local-part of an email address (e.g. anonymous@domain.tld)
  'CUSTOM_TAG' => '', // Specify a custom query tag instead of the default (Domain+Page).
  'BLOCKED_COUNTRIES' => array('Wakanda', 'WA'), // Specify an array of countries or isocodes to be blocked.
  'ALLOWED_COUNTRIES' => array('Azeroth', 'AJ') // Specify an array of countries or isocodes to be allowed.
);
  
$result_array = \proxycheck\proxycheck::check($address, $proxycheck_options);
```
In the above example we have included both countries and isocodes in both the ```BLOCKED_COUNTRIES``` and ```ALLOWED_COUNTRIES``` field. That is because as of 0.1.3 (May 2019) this library now supports both for use in these arrays. You can think of these two fields like a local whitelist/blacklist feature but only for countries.

## Viewing the query result ##

When performing a query you will receive back an array which contains various information. Below is an example of parsing that array to determine if this user should be blocked or not. Please note the block and block_reason results are only populated when checking a single address, when passing an array of addresses to perform a multi-check these variables will both contain ```na```.

```php
if ( $result_array['block'] == "yes" ) {
    
  // Example of a block and the reason why.
  echo "Blocked, reason: " . $result_array['block_reason'];
  exit;

} else {
    
  // No Proxy / VPN / Blocked Country detected.
  echo "Not blocked.";
    
}
```

## Extra information included in the query result ##

When performing a query you will receive not just ```block: yes/no``` and ```block_reason: [reason]``` but also the entirety of the API response from proxycheck.io, we do this so you can either make an easy block system or utilise the data presented by the API as you see fit. A full result example is shown below.

```php
Array
(
    [status] => ok/warning/denied/error
    [node] => answering_node_name
    [###.###.###.###] => Array
        (
            [asn] => AS#####
            [range] => ###.###.###.###/24
            [hostname] => 78-2-adsl.acme.net
            [provider] => Acme Incorporated
            [organisation] => Acme Net
            [country] => Wakanda
            [isocode] => WA
            [region] => Wakanda North
            [regioncode] => WAN
            [city] => Birnin Zana
            [postcode] => BZ967
            [latitude] => 2.5072
            [longitude] => -0.1276
            [currency] => Array
                (
                    [code] => VD
                    [name] => Vibranium Dollar
                    [symbol] => $
                )
            [proxy] => yes/no
            [type] => VPN/SOCKS5/SOCKS4/SOCKS/HTTP/HTTPS/Compromised Server
            [risk] => 0 to 100
            [port] => #####
            [last seen human] => 6 hours, 18 minutes, 49 seconds ago
            [last seen unix] => 1528687645
        )
    [block] => yes/no
    [block_reason] => proxy/vpn/country
)
```

In the above example the ```status``` field lets you know the status of this query. You can view all our API responses [here](https://proxycheck.io/api/) within our API documentation page. Also where in our example we show ```###.###.###.###``` you will receive the actual address you sent to the API for checking.

## Viewing Statistics from your Dashboard ##

In version 0.1.3 (May 2019) we added the ability to view statistics from your account dashboard through this library. Below is an example of how to do that.

```php
$proxycheck_options = array(
  'API_KEY' => '', // Your API Key.
  'TLS_SECURITY' => 0, // Enable or disable transport security (TLS).
  'STAT_SELECTION' => 'usage', // Stats to view: detections, usage or queries
  'LIMIT' => '10', // Specify how many entries to view (applies to detection stats only)
  'OFFSET' => '0' // Specify an offset in the entries to view (applies to detection stats only)
);
    
$result_array = \proxycheck\proxycheck::stats($proxycheck_options);
```
When accessing dashboard API's an API Key is always required as the dashboard is only for registered users (both free and paid have full dashboard access). You will also need to make sure you have Dashboard API access enabled [within your dashboard](https://proxycheck.io/dashboard/) on our website.

You can see that in the ```STAT_SELECTION``` field we are providing the name of the stat we would like to view. In this example we have selected ```usage``` but you can also check detections or queries. This library will also support future stat types automatically.

Below is an example of how this result would look.

```php
Array
(
    [Queries Today] => 234
    [Daily Limit] => 1000
    [Queries Total] => 840931
    [Plan Tier] => Free
)
```

When viewing the ```detections``` stat you can also provide a limit (which is how many entries to show you) and offset (which is how many entries to skip over before starting to show you any results).

So for example if you had 100 entries and you only wanted to view entries 31 to 40 you would supply 10 as a limit and 30 as an offset.

## Manipulating your CORS Origins, Whitelist or Blacklist ##

In version 0.1.2 (Nov 2018) we added the ability to view, add, remove, set and clear your whitelist and blacklist through this library, in December 2020 a CORS API was added to proxycheck.io and the below code also works for that. Below is an example of adding three entries to your whitelist in a single query.

```php
$proxycheck_options = array(
  'API_KEY' => '', // Your API Key.
  'TLS_SECURITY' => 0, // Enable or disable transport security (TLS).
  'LIST_SELECTION' => 'whitelist', // Specify the list you're accessing: CORS, whitelist or blacklist
  'LIST_ACTION' => 'add', // Specify an action: list, add, remove, set or clear.
  'LIST_ENTRIES' => array('8.8.8.8', '1.1.1.1/24', 'AS888') // Origins, IPs, Ranges, ASN's or Emails to be added, removed or set
);
    
$result_array = \proxycheck\proxycheck::listing($proxycheck_options);
```

When accessing dashboard API's an API Key is always required as the dashboard is only for registered users (both free and paid have full dashboard access). You will also need to make sure you have Dashboard API access enabled [within your dashboard](https://proxycheck.io/dashboard/) on our website.

You can see that in the LIST_ENTRIES field we are providing an array of three seperate entries, this field is only used if you're performing an add, remove or set action. When providing entries in the LIST_ENTRIES field you can include comments, for example ```'LIST_ENTRIES' => array('8.8.8.8 #this is google')``` would create a new entry with the comment intact.

This LIST_ENTRIES field can also be used when adding, setting or removing origins for use with the CORS feature. In this situation comments are not supported, only domains (including wildcard domains such as \*.example.com). All LIST_ACTION types are supported with CORS in the same way they are with Whitelist/Blacklist manipulation.

If a white or blacklist entry you're removing has a comment next to it you will need to include that comment in the removal request aswell, like in the example above where we included a comment next to the IP address we were adding you would do the same when removing it.
